  "Description": "The [Fortinet FortiWeb Cloud](https://www.fortinet.com/products/web-application-firewall/fortiweb) solution for Microsoft Sentinel provides an automated approach for SecOps analysts to remediate attacks at application level by blocking suspicious IP and URL and also empowers to gather threat intelligence data for malicious IP activity. By leveraging the FortiWeb API, the connector can automate these security operations' tasks using Sentinel Playbooks which can dramatically reduces the window that attackers can take advantage of.",
