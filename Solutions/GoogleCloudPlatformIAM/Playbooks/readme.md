## Authentication
This connector supports OAuth2.0 authentication. Refer to the GoogleCloudPlatformIAM Custom Connector documentation for more details.

<a name="prerequisites">

### Prerequisites in GCP
To configure the connector follow the instructions:
1. Deploy the connector using **Deploy to Azure** button.
2. Enable Identity and Access Management (IAM) API in GCP Console (see [instructions](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server#enable-apis)).
3. Create authorization credentials (see [instructions](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server#creatingcred)). As a redirection url, use the redirection url that you can find on the connector page (in Azure go to **Logic Apps Custom Connector** -> **GoogleCloudPlatformIAM** -> click **Edit** -> **Security** -> copy *Redirect URL*). If this is your first time creating a client ID, you can also configure your consent screen by clicking Consent Screen. (The [following procedure](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en#userconsent) explains how to set up the Consent screen.) You won't be prompted to configure the consent screen after you do it the first time. Note that [the following scope](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes#iam) has to be enabled in the consent screen.
4. In Azure go to **Logic Apps Custom Connector** -> **GoogleCloudPlatformIAM** -> click **Edit** -> **Security** -> fill the *Client id* and *Client secret*, obtained in the previous step -> click **Update connector**.
