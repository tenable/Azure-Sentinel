#  Add-HostToWatchlist
Author: Yaniv Shasha
This playbook will add a Host entity to a new or existing watchlist.

## Logical flow to use this playbook

	1. The analyst finished investigating an incident and one of its findings is a suspicious Host entity.
	2. The analyst wants to enter this entity into a watchlist (can be from block list type or allowed list).
	3. This playbook will run as a manual trigger from the full incident blade or the investigation graph blade, or automatically, and will add host to the selected watchlist.
