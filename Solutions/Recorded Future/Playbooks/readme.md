# Roles and permissions for working with Recorded Future Solution

The following article describes roles and permissions for working with Microsoft Sentinel [Roles and permissions in Microsoft Sentinel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/roles).

To install and manage Playbooks/Logic Apps, the following permissions are required on the resource group [Microsoft Sentinel Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#microsoft-sentinel-contributor) + [Logic App Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#logic-app-contributor).

# Connectors authorization 
Each connector needs to be authorized after playbook installation. Expand all nodes in the logic app after installation and look for blocks marked with a warning sign. Open and authorize the connection. More information about each connector can be found below. 

Recorded Future solution use the following connectors:
- **/recordedfuturev2** - Microsoft power platform connectors 
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/recordedfuturev2/. All logic apps require APIKeys to communicate with the Recorded Future API. To obtain APIKeys, please visit [Recorded Future Requesting API Tokens](https://support.recordedfuture.com/hc/en-us/articles/4411077373587-Requesting-API-Tokens).
- **/microsoftgraphsecurity** - Microsoft power platform connectors https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/microsoftgraphsecurity/
- **/azuresentinel** - Microsoft power platform connectors https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/azuresentinel/


# Deployment

> **Due to internal Microsoft Logic Apps dependencies, please deploy ImportToSentinel playbook before any of the IndicatorProcessor playbooks.**

## ImportToSentinel

This playbook will serve all the IndicatorProcessor playbooks with batch import of ThreatIntelligenceIndicator. This will optimize import of the indicators from Recorded Future to Microsoft Sentinel.

### Configuration of Enrichment playbook
After the enrichment playbook is installed and connections are configured. Create an automation rule to automate the enrichment process. The enrichment playbook will add recorded future intelligence to known entities in the incident as incident comment. 

![](./RecordedFuture-IOC_Enrichment-IP_Domain_URL_Hash/images/CreateAutomationRuleMenu.png)<br/>

In Sentinel goto Automation and create [Automation rule]. Give the new rule a name, select trigger [When incident is created], Action [Run playbook] and select [RecordedFuture-IOC_Enrichment-IP_Domain_URL_Hash] as the playbook to run. 

![](./RecordedFuture-IOC_Enrichment-IP_Domain_URL_Hash/images/CreateAutomationRule.png)<br/>

This will trigger Recorded Future playbook to run when any incident is created. Recorded future will then enrich the incident if it contains entities of type IP, Domain, Url and FileHash.
