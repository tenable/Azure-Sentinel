## Overview
This playbook uses the DomainTools Iris Investigate API. Track the activities of malicious actors using the Iris Investigate UI, tagging domains of interest. Given a domain or set of domains associated with an incident, query Iris Investigate for information on those domains, and if a specified set of tags is observed, mark the incident as “severe” in Sentinel and add a comment.
 
Learn more about the Custom Connector via https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/domaintoolsirisinves or visit https://www.domaintools.com/integrations to request an API key.

This playbook works as follows:
- It fetches all the Domain objects in the Incident.
- Iterate through the Domain objects and fetch the results from DomaintTools Iris Investigate for each Domain.
- If the Domain contains any malicious tags defined in the "Malicious_Tags" parameter of the playbook, those domains will be added as comments, and also if any malicious tags are found in any of the Domain in the Incident, the Incident will be set to "High Severity".

### Post-Deployment instructions
#### a. Authorize connections: 
Once deployment is complete, you will need to authorize each connection:
- Open the Logic App in the edit mode.
- Open "For each" Action.
- Provide connection details for the DomainTools Iris Investigate Custom Connector (A DomainTools API Username and API Key need to be provided).

  ![for_each](./graphics/for_each.png)
- Click on "Add New", provide a name for the connection, enter your DomainTools Investigate API Username and API Key.
- Click "Create".
- Repeat these steps for any other connections and select the connection details created above.
  ![connection](./graphics/connection.png)
- Save the Logic App. If the Logic App prompts any missing connections, please update the connections similarly.
- As a best practice, we have used the Sentinel connection in Logic Apps that use "ManagedSecurityIdentity" permissions. Please refer to [this document](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/what-s-new-managed-identity-for-azure-sentinel-logic-apps/ba-p/2068204) and provide permissions to the Logic App accordingly.
#### b. Configurations in Sentinel:
- In Azure Sentinel, analytical rules should be configured to trigger an incident with risky Domain indicators. 
- Configure the automation rules to trigger the playbook.
