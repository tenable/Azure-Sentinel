# Overview
This playbook uses the DomainTools Iris Enrich API, which we recommend over Iris Investigate for high-volume API lookup activities. It is able to provide domain infrastructure information for a domain or set of domains associated with an incident. If your account is provisioned for Iris Enrich, use the Iris Enrich endpoint to return Whois, mailserver, DNS, SSL and related indicators from Iris Enrich for a given domain or set of domains.
 
You can learn more about the Custom Connector via https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/domaintoolsirisenric or visit https://www.domaintools.com/integrations to request an API key.

When a new Azure Sentinel Incident is created, this playbook gets triggered and performs the following actions:

- It fetches all the Domain objects in the Incident.
- Iterates through the Domain objects and fetches the results from DomaintTools Iris Enrich for each Domain.
- All the details from DomainTools Iris Enrich will be added as comments in a tabular format.

### Post-Deployment instructions
#### a. Authorize connections
Once deployment is complete, you will need to authorize each connection:
- Open the Logic App in the edit mode.
- Open "For each Host" Action.
- Provide connection details for the DomainTools Iris Enrich Custom Connector (A DomainTools API Username and API Key need to be provided).
  
  ![for_each](./graphics/for_each.png)
- Click on "Add New", provide a name for the connection, enter your DomainTools Iris Enrich API Username and API Key.
- Click "Create".
- Repeat these steps for any other connections and select the connection details created above.
  ![connection](./graphics/connection.png)
- Save the Logic App. If the Logic App prompts any missing connections, please update the connections similarly.
- As a best practice, we have used the Sentinel connection in Logic Apps that use "ManagedSecurityIdentity" permissions. Please refer to [this document](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/what-s-new-managed-identity-for-azure-sentinel-logic-apps/ba-p/2068204) and provide permissions to the Logic App accordingly.
#### b. Configurations in Sentinel:
- In Azure Sentinel, analytical rules should be configured to trigger an incident with risky Domain indicators.
- Configure the automation rules to trigger the playbook.
