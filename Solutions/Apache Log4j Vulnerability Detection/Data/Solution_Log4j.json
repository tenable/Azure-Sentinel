  "Description": "Microsoft's security research teams have been tracking threats taking advantage of [CVE-2021-44228](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2021-44228), a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in [Apache Log4j 2](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) referred to as “Log4Shell”. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote code execution, and it is triggered when a specially crafted string provided by the attacker through a variety of different input vectors is parsed and processed by the Log4j 2 vulnerable component. For more technical and mitigation information about the vulnerability, please read the [Microsoft Security Response Center blog](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/12/11/microsofts-response-to-cve-2021-44228-apache-log4j2/). This solution provides content to monitor, detect and investigate signals related to exploitation of this vulnerability in Microsoft Sentinel.",
