name: Malicious Connection to LDAP port for CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability
description: |
  'This hunting query looks for connection to the default LDAP ports to find possible exploitation attempts for CVE-2021-44228 involving log4j vulnerability.
   The attack is not limited only to these ports. Log4j is an open-source Apache logging library that is used in many Java-based applications. 
   Awareness of normal baseline traffic of an environment for java.exe while using this query will help determine normal from anomalous.
