Description: |
  This ASIM tabular function is intended for use in ASIM Network related parsers and sets the NetworkIcmpCode and NetworkIcmpType fields based on a numerical protocol number provided as a parameter. For example, for the 8 as an input, the function sets NetworkIcmpCode to 8, and NetworkIcmpType to "Echo" . The function is invoked using the [invoke operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/invokeoperator) and requires the source table to have a TimeGenerated field.
