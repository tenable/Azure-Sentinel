# SyncMSServiceTags

#### Problem : 
Azure Service Tags gets updated every now and then which is a list of IP addresses for Azure / Microsoft Data centers.
All the existing references need to be changed based on this as the URL for json file depends upon date.
E.g. â€“ ServiceTags_Public_20220307.json
#### Solution : 
A GitHub workflow to run every 14days to check the latest version of the list and updates to a json file.
This file can a be a single source of reference across.
